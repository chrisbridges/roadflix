This application allows the user to input an origin location and a destination to determine the length of a road trip they may be embarking on. The app will then allow the user to create a playlist of popular movies that they can watch during this trip. The app determines the runtime of each movie the user adds to their list and then will alert the user when they have added enough movies to their queue to last them the length of their road trip.
